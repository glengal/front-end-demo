# Frontend Demo

I have setup an empty boilerplate with create-react-app. Make sure you have node and npm installed and run ```npm install``` and then ```npm start``` to test your application. To run your the tests you can run ```npm test```.

### Functionality

**Step 1**

Only the following elements should be visible on first load.
- Header
- City input
- Checkin input (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Checkout input (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Search button

The 3 inputs will be string inputs. Do not worry about form validation and no need for any fancy datepicker or autocomplete functionalities.
